# Integration-with-Numerical-Method-and-comparision-with-direct-integration
I created a Numerical Integration Calculator in MATLAB as part of my BSc in Mechanical Engineering coursework. This project aimed to enhance my understanding of numerical methods, specifically for solving engineering problems
Here one can input the function as a string and the code will convert it to a function. Users can choose 5 modes to calculate by. The modes are the Trapezoidal Method, Simpsons's 1/3 rule, Simpson's 3/8 rule, Weddle Rule, and Direct Integration.
